# Student Crowd-Purchasing Application
This project will seek to help students budget effectively through ‘crowd purchasing’, by creating an application which will bring together students who share interests in buying common household and grocery items. The focus of this application is to bring students together who will benefit from crowd purchasing. Therefore, it is aimed at students who share accommodation with other students, making it easier to split their purchases equally. However, the app can also be used by students who do not live with each other. The proposed application will enable students to benefit from economies of scale, getting more for their money.
